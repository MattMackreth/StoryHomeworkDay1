# Using hashes to create a story and have a user edit it

To tackle this task I first created an initial story with a beginning middle
and end as well as hero, villain, title and author fields. I then had the user
give inputs to change the hero and villain of the story and used the replace function
to change the contents of each part of the story.

## What extras did I include
### An if statement
I included an if statement to change the end of the story based
on who the user wants to win.
### A while loop
I included a do while loop to keep asking the user to pick who wins until they 
either input hero or villain (case insensitive)
